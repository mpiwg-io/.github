# Charter

The purpose of the MPI I/O Working Group is to discuss and implement the changes and new features
related to I/O operations, including operations on files, and also looking toward storing data in
object stores.

The chairs of the working group are Quincey Koziol, Suren Byna, Jean-Luca Bez, Edgar Gabriel,
and Jannek Squar.

https://lists.mpi-forum.org/mailman/listinfo/mpiwg-io is our public email list.  Meeting topics
and other updates will be sent to the mailing list, but most discussions occur on the MPI Forum's
Slack workspace (https://mpi-forum.slack.com/) in the #wg-file channel.

The primary location for topics under consideration is the io-issues repository
(https://github.com/mpiwg-io/io-issues) and meeting info and notes are stored in the wiki
for that repository (https://github.com/mpiwg-io/io-issues/wiki).
